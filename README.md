[Resume](https://dusterthefirst.com/resume)

I am a College Student @ TU/e who loves to program and work on hobby electronics
in my free time. I have recently gotten into active stabilization of model rocketry
and keep a (somewhat up to date) devlog on my website [rocketry.dusterthefirst.com][rocketry-website].
I am an absolute fanatic for [rust], [react], [typescript], and the new
[Raspberry PI Pico][pico].
